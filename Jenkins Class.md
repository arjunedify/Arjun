**JENKINS**

- **Jenkins** is an open source automation server. It helps **automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying** , facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery.

- **DevOps** is a set of practices that works to automate and integrate the processes between software development and IT teams, **so they can build, test, and release software faster and more reliably**.

- **CI/CD** bridges the gaps between development and operation activities and teams by **enforcing automation in building, testing and deployment of applications**.

- If your tasks are repeatable i.e done in the same way over a time period, then **JENKINS can simply automate the repeatable process**.

**Continuous Integration - CI**

- Continuous Integration is a DevOps practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository(GitHub), after which automated builds and tests are run.

- In Continuous Integration each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing everyone to detect and be notified of problems with the build immediately

**Continuous Deployment - CD**

- Continuous Deployment is an extension to Continuous Integration
- Continuous Deployment is a DevOps practice where code changes are automatically prepared for a release to Production.
