# **Create AZURE VM**

# **Create AWS EC2 Instance**

# **Install Putty**

**Setup Putty**

- Visit following site and **Install Putty**
  - [https://www.putty.org/](https://www.putty.org/)

# **Convert pem file to ppk file**

**Convert your private key using PuTTYgen**

- PuTTY does not natively support the private key format for SSH keys. PuTTY provides a tool named **PuTTYgen** , which converts keys to the required format for PuTTY. You must convert your private key (.pem file) into this format (.ppk file) as follows in order to connect to your instance using PuTTY.

**To convert your private key**

\> From the **Start** menu, choose **All Programs** , **PuTTY** , **PuTTYgen**.

![image](https://github.com/arjunedify/Arjun/assets/132984407/e0be01b9-4d0b-43dc-8007-79480c03e69a)

\> Choose **Load**. By default, PuTTYgen displays only files with the extension .ppk. To locate your .pem file, choose the option to display files of all types.
 ![image](https://github.com/arjunedify/Arjun/assets/132984407/05fb6d51-5fff-4d92-9a72-bf74c695ddfc)

\> Select your .pem file for the key pair that you specified when you launched your instance and choose **Open**. PuTTYgen displays a notice that the .pem file was successfully imported. Choose **OK**.

![image](https://github.com/arjunedify/Arjun/assets/132984407/47a7ca1d-2907-4bbd-ba56-fa2852fc928d)

\> To save the key in the format that PuTTY can use, choose **Save private key**. PuTTYgen displays a warning about saving the key without a passphrase. Choose **Yes**.

![image](https://github.com/arjunedify/Arjun/assets/132984407/1f3c6f11-f744-4b36-9b52-4bab67d2f6de)

\> Specify the same name for the key that you used for the key pair (for example, my-key-pair) and choose **Save**. PuTTY automatically adds the .ppk file extension.

\> Your private key is now in the correct format for use with PuTTY. You can now connect to your instance using PuTTY's SSH client.

**To connect to your instance using PuTTY**

1. Start PuTTY (from the **Start** menu, choose **All Programs, PuTTY, PuTTY** ).
2. In the **Category** pane, choose **Session** and complete the following fields:
  1. In the **Host Name** box, do one of the following:
    1. enter your public IP Address or Public DNS Name
    2. Ensure that the **Port** value is 22.
    3. Under **Connection type** , select **SSH**.

![image](https://github.com/arjunedify/Arjun/assets/132984407/400c62bf-bda0-4e82-a919-07d42bc8d2c3)

In the **Category** pane, expand **Connection** , expand **SSH** , and then choose **Auth**. Complete the following:

1. Choose **Browse**.

\> If this is the first time you have connected to this instance, PuTTY displays a security alert dialog box that asks whether you trust the host to which you are connecting.

# **Convert a pem key to ppk key**

##
# PEM to PPK conversion steps

Here are the steps to quickly convert a PEM to a PPK file with PuTTYGen:

1. Download PuTTYGen from [puttygen.com](https://www.puttygen.com/)
2. Open PuTTYGen and click the _Load_ button
3. Set the filetype to  **\*.\***  so the AWS PEM file is visible
4. Select your PEM file and PuTTYGen will import it
5. Click _Save Private Key_ and PuTTYGen will convert the PEM to a PPK file

Step 3 often causes problems, because the file selector is set to PPK so the PEM will not be visible even if you select the correct folder. Just change the filetype to \*.\* and every filetype will be visible.

Upon import, PuTTYgen explains how to convert an SSH PEM to a PPK format for use with PuTTY.
